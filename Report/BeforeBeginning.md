# Before Beginning
+ Report pattern
  - I have used a problem-solution pattern in this report.

+ CI/CD
  - I have faced few problems with Jenkins & Tomcat configurations, started to solve them one by one. Unfortunately
      in the given period of time, I had to decide whether to implement a proper CI/CD, or writing a good descriptive
      report, where my intention was to create a pipeline that triggers deploying a new docker container with each 
      build, but in the end, I ended up without implementing CI/CD for this project.

+ Effective Java Book
  - I could not finish the whole book in time, but I ended up reading about 70% of the book, even though I believe not 
      all the points written in the book are defensible or related to what I have done in this project, but I decided
      to defend the points that are related to what I have done in this project and aware of.
