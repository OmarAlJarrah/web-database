# Before Beginning
+ Report pattern
  - I have used a problem-solution pattern in this report.

+ CI/CD
  - I have faced few problems with Jenkins & Tomcat configurations, started to solve them one by one. Unfortunately
      in the given period of time, I had to decide whether to implement a proper CI/CD, or writing a good descriptive
      report, where my intention was to create a pipeline that triggers deploying a new docker container with each 
      build, but in the end, I almost gave up, but what I did is, I used dockerfile to generate a docker image for jenkins, 
      configuring it manually, and adding a shell script for manual deployment, what I made for thr CI/CD part is untested, 
      I could do better, but in the end, this is my product.

+ Effective Java Book
  - I could not finish the whole book in time, but I ended up reading about 70% of the book, even though I believe not 
      all the points written in the book are defensible or related to what I have done in this project, but I decided
      to defend the points that are related to what I have done in this project and aware of.

+ I noticed that we can't use spring right at the moment of submission, as I used spring, I decided to use the last few 
hours in converting my project into a Java EE application, for that reason, I am submitting to versions of the code.
